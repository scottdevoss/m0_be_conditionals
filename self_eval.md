# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

Conditionals are useful when we are evaluating and comparing multiple different data types. This helps print different answers based on values that the user inputs. 

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

I would try to use different comparison operators to test my understanding of how they work. 
For example, using != true instead of == and changing the input to false. 

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

It was satisfying to change the different values and get different outputs based on the values. Just confirming our program we made works.
